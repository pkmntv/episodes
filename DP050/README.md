# DP050

[Tag! We're It...!][1]

Original [m3u8][2] copied from [source][3]

Fixed [m3u8][4]

Note, this file could not be fixed by enumerating missing characters. In this case there are 9 characters missing,
with 16‚Åπ (68,719,476,736) possible combinations - somewhat infeasible to brute force.
Instead, the transport stream slices were recovered from the path and the predictable naming (e.g. playlist0.ts, playlist1.ts etc.)
A new MP3 url has been created to refer to these slices and this is what is contained in the master playlist url for the stream
with bandwidth 1456000 bps.
