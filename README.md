# episodes

episodes is a simple repo that contains master playlist [m3u8][1] files for
[Pok√©mon TV][2] that have been corrected. Some of the [CDN][3] that host the
m3u8 files, notably [Limelight Networks][4], return text responses where the
content is truncated.

As the [HLS][5] component m3u8 playlist files follow a predictable pattern,
e.g. playlist-_[0-9a-f]{40}_.m3u8, the full urls can be rediscovered through
brute force enumeration of the remaining characters.
